# Data and references

The research used pinned provider snapshots for security histories, factor returns, comparison portfolios and macroeconomic inputs. This repository publishes computational source, tests using synthetic or hand-calculated inputs, derived statistics and figures. It contains no provider downloads, security-level panels, vendor return series or account-access information. Independent access to the original inputs is separate from this public package.

| Source | Role in the study |
|---|---|
| [Sharadar](https://sharadar.com/) | Daily equity prices, market capitalizations, security identifiers and corporate actions for universe construction, signals, portfolios and terminal-return handling. |
| [Kenneth R. French Data Library](https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html) | Daily and monthly Fama–French three-factor returns and risk-free rates; momentum references and decile portfolios for reconciliation, historical-volatility replication and baseline calibration. |
| [Jensen, Kelly and Pedersen Global Factor Data](https://jkpfactors.com/data) | US capped-value-weighted raw and residual momentum portfolios, used for reconciliation and long-history comparisons. |
| [FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) | VIXCLS, BAA10Y and T10Y3M for the macroeconomic robustness block; USREC for descriptive recession shading only. |

The provider snapshots were aligned by observation date. Publication lags and subsequent data revisions were not reconstructed. Some early capitalizations use later share counts as a disclosed approximation; terminal returns are partly imputed. These features make the study a final-vintage historical comparison. [Research design](research_design.md) states the resulting limits.
